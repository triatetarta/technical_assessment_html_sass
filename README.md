# Technical Test - Documentation

### Technologies used:

1. **HTML5**

2. **SCSS/SASS**

### How I did it:

1. **Downloaded the assets from the attached Adobe Xd file**

2. **Implemented the fonts used with google fonts and placed the link tag inside of index.html**

3. **Created folder structures**

4. **Inside scss folder, created a partial scss file for variables - helpful when a project scales up so it's easier to maintain or make changes**

5. **Inside card component I created an article tag - hypothetically the card is rendered inside a section (cc App.js file on React for example)**

6. **I used BEM convention for class naming**

7. **All sizes, weights and spacing are based on original design**

8. **Walked an extra mile by adding some CSS hover animations**
